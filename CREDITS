* I have to give the first credit to my Wife who puts up with me programming
  stuff for free when there are more productive analog things to be doing ;)

* configure scripts were initialy done by Victor Brilon <victor@vail.net>

* Japanesation patches were provided by Hiroshi Kawashima <kei@arch.sony.co.jp>

* Alex Varju <alex@varju.bc.ca> sent me a patch for displaying due dates in
  todos, and also a fix for a small bug where I didn't sort them correctly.
  I had priority/date and date/priority reversed.
