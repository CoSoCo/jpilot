This is a J-Pilot plugin program which provides an interface for 
KeyRing for PalmOS.  KeyRing is a palm application that stores 
records with 3DES encryption. 

More information on KeyRing and downloads can be found at:
http://gnukeyring.sourceforge.net

REQUIREMENTS:

OpenSSL was used for encryption.  You will have to get it and install it 
separately from J-pilot.  Since the U.S.A. exports on encryption have 
been loosened it should be freely available and included in new distributions.

There is no autoconf (configure) detection of OpenSSL, so you may have to
edit the Makefile appropriately if its not installed in a standard place.

BUGS:
 There is one major bug that I know of.  When you change the master 
 passwords on the palm KeyRing program it will re-encrypt all the 
 stored password data.  If you have unsynced records in J-Pilot, 
 they will not get re-encrypted and will be garbage.  I could fix this, 
 but its just too much work.  Just sync before changing your password.

 Sort order isn't the same that as on the palm.
