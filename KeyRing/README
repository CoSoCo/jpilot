This is a J-Pilot plugin program which provides an interface to 
KeyRing for PalmOS.  KeyRing is a Palm application that stores 
records with 3DES encryption. 

More information on KeyRing and downloads can be found at:
http://gnukeyring.sourceforge.net

REQUIREMENTS:

GNU libgcrypt is the default library used for encryption as it has fewer
usage restrictions than the alternative -- OpenSSL libraries.  Use of 
OpenSSL can be forced by passing --with-openssl to the configure script.

There is no autoconf (configure) detection of OpenSSL.  If you have not
installed the libraries in the standard location you may have to
edit the Makefile appropriately.

BUGS:
 There is one major bug that I know of.  When you change the master 
 password on the Palm KeyRing program it will re-encrypt all the 
 stored password data.  If you have unsynced records in J-Pilot, 
 they will not get re-encrypted and will be garbage.  I could fix this, 
 but its just too much work.  Just sync before changing your password.

 Sort order isn't the same that as on the Palm.
