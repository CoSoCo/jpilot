=== Web ======================================================================
For the latest news, versions, documents, plugins, etc.
http://jpilot.org
==============================================================================


=== Documents ================================================================
Be sure to read the docs in the doc directory, or if installed from the RPM
in /usr/doc/jpilot-0.99.6/.
==============================================================================


=== Upgrading ================================================================
Before upgrading versions of J-Pilot always sync your palm and back up your
data just to be on the safe side.
==============================================================================


=== Requirements =============================================================
To compile J-Pilot you need to have GTK+ 1.2 or higher installed.
You can find out what version you have by running "gtk-config --version".
GTK+ requires glib.  The glib version probably should match the gtk version.
You can also do a "glib-config --version".
You can get these at http://www.gtk.org

Pilot link must be installed and working.
http://www.pilot-link.org
RedHat users must also have the pilot-link-dev rpm installed for the header
 files so that jpilot can compile.  You don't need these if you install the
jpilot RPM.

If you want i18n support you should have gettext installed.  Preferably GNU
gettext.  If you don't have or want it use "configure --disable-nls"
==============================================================================


=== Compiling ================================================================
To compile and install do the following:
./configure --prefix=/usr  (configure --help will list all the options.)
make
make install
jpilot

make uninstall is an option also.
To make an rpm just do rpm -tb jpilot-{version}.tar.gz
  On some systems use rpmbuild -tb jpilot-{version}.tar.gz
==============================================================================


=== Plugins =================================================================
I have added an example plugin Expense to match the palm Expense application.
I have included 2 other plugins:
SyncTime - This sets the time on the pilot from the desktop clock.
KeyRing - KeyRing is a GNU licensed palm application to keep encrypted
 passwords and other data.

configure --disable-plugins can be used if plugins aren't desired.
==============================================================================


=== Irix =====================================================================
Irix uses different lib directories for shared libraries.
Plugins have to be installed in different directories for this reason.
Before compiling you can use:
for ELF 64-bit: "export ABILIB=lib64"
for ELF N32:    "export ABILIB=lib32"
for ELF 32-bit: "export ABILIB=lib"
==============================================================================


=== Compile Errors ===========================================================
Message:
  bash$ jpilot
  jpilot: error in loading shared libraries: libpisock.so.4: cannot open
  shared object file: No such file or directory
  bash$

Solution:
  libpisock.so is the pilot-link shared library.
  J-Pilot uses this library to talk over the serial port to the palm.
  You can find it by doing a "locate libpisock".
  Shared libraries are loaded at runtime, not compile time.
  This error is caused by ld.so not being able to find libpisock.so
  You can fix this by either adding the path to libpisock.so to the environment
  variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  Do this by
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/libpath in bash, some other shells have
  different syntax.  This can be put in your .bashrc, or profile, etc.
  The other way to fix it is to add the path to libpisock in /etc/ld.so.conf
  and then run ldconfig.  You need root to do this.
==============================================================================


=== Disclaimer ===============================================================
J-Pilot was written in such a way that it should be very safe to sync.
There is always the possibility of something going wrong though.  As with
anything else, backup your data if you cannot afford to lose it.
