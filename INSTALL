To compile J-Pilot you need to have GTK+1.2 or better.
You can find out what version you have by running "gtk-config --version".
GTK+ requires glib.  The glib version probably should match the gtk version.
You can also do a "glib-config --version".
You can get these at http://www.gtk.org

Pilot link must be installed and working.
ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/
RedHat users must also have the pilot-link-dev rpm installed for the header
 files so that jpilot can compile.

To compile and install do the following:
./configure
make
make install
jpilot

For Japanese support, use ./configure --with-japanese, ./configure --help
will list all the options.

make uninstall is an option also.

I have included a spec file so if you want to create your own RPM all you
have to do is "rpm -tb jpilot-0.93.tar.gz"


Currently, you have to sync before the program will behave correctly.
It won't do anything horrible, just file read errors.
I'll fix this someday.
JPilot was written in such a way that it should be very safe to sync.
I have had no reports of data being corrupted, or lost.  There is always
that possibility though.  As with anything else, backup your data if you
cannot afford to lose it.  Just make sure your backup software destroy it
first ;)
