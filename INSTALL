You need to have gtk1.2 or better.
gtk requires glib.
you can get these at http://www.gtk.org

pilot link must be installed and working.
ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/
RedHat users must also have the pilot-link-dev rpm installed for the header
 files.

jpilot currently uses the PILOTPORT and PILOTRATE environment variables, as
does pilot-link.


edit the first few lines of Makefile if neccessary.
make
mkdir ~/.jpilot/
cp jpilotrc ~/.jpilot/ (or you can do a cp jpilotrc.blue ~/.jpilot/jpilotrc
 if you like blue better)
./jpilot
Put the executable in /usr/local/bin, or somewhere.


Currently, you have to sync before the program will behave correctly.
JPilot was written in such a way that it should be very safe to sync.
I have had no reports of data being corrupted, or lost.  There is always
that possibility though.  As with anything else, backup your data if you
cannot afford to lose it.  Just make sure your backup software destroy it
first ;)
