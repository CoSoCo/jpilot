you need to have gtk1.2 or better (I haven't tried anything older)
gtk requires glib.
you can get these at http://www.gtk.org

pilot link must be installed and working.
ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/

edit the first few lines of Makefile
make
mkdir ~/.jpilot/
cp jpilotrc ~/.jpilot/
jpilot
you may want to sync before you do anything
