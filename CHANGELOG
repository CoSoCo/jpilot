 Fixed some feof() problem that caused datebook to not work on RedHat 6.0
 I rewrote the entire datebook.c file
 Put in code to create and test for writability of ~/.jpilot/
 Put it gtk_set_locale() for other language support on Solaris.
 Moved syncing code from datebook.c to sync.c
 Created a jpilot-syncd, a daemon syncing program.
 Made Feb 29th (Leap Day) yearly appointments repeat on the 28th of non-Leap
   years, just as on the palm pilot.
 Also fixed monthly repeating appointments that occur past the last day in the
  current month. These didn't use to appear in jpilot.
 Fixed a few bugs in creating new repeat monthly appointments.
 Fixed a few bugs in displaying monthly repeating appointments.
 When creating a monthly appointment that repeats "By Day":
  Added in a dialog box to ask if an appointment is intended to repeat in the
  4th occurence of that day in the a month, or the last occurence of that day
  in the month.  This is only asked when it cannot be deduced.
  The Palm Pilot will also ask this question.
