 Made Feb 29th (Leap Day) yearly appointments repeat on the 28th of non-Leap

  current month. These didn't use to appear in jpilot.

 Fixed a few bugs in displaying monthly repeating appointments.
 When creating a monthly appointment that repeats "By Day":
  Added in a dialog box to ask if an appointment is intended to repeat in the
  4th occurence of that day in the a month, or the last occurence of that day
  in the month.  This is only asked when it cannot be deduced.
  The Palm Pilot will also ask this question.
