*Priority High:

*Priority Medium:

*Priority Low:

 - Things don't work quite right if you've never synced before.

 - It seems like the sync doesn't always work with xcopilot.
 If xcopilot hasn't been run in a while and you don't set the date on it, it
 seems to not update the datebase modification times correctly.  On every sync
 it would not bring back the palm database because the modification time
 hadn't changed.  pilot-xfer behaves the same way.
 I set the time on xcopilot and then could not reproduce this problem again.

*Priority Who Cares?:
 - If you click really fast on the buttons to scroll through the months, then
 it will segmentation fault.
 I think I have fixed this though.

*Quirks (not really bugs):

 - jpilot lets you enter in blank todo's, etc.  The palm pilot will not allow
 this.

 - The palm pilot will only let you make appointments on 5 minute intervals.
 jpilot will allow 1 minute intervals.
