If you wish to report a bug, and the bug is reproduceable it may be helpful to
me if you run jpilot -d to run in debug mode, reproduce the error and then
send me the log file from ~/.jpilot/jpilot.log

----------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the bugs that I know about:

*Priority High:

*Priority Medium:

*Priority Low:

 - Things don't work quite right if you've never synced before.
 - I'll probably fix this some day.

*Priority Who Cares?:

*Quirks (not really bugs):

 - jpilot lets you enter in blank todo's, etc.  The palm pilot will not allow
 this.

 - The palm pilot will only let you make appointments on 5 minute intervals.
 jpilot will allow 1 minute intervals.
