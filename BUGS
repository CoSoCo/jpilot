If you wish to report a bug, and the bug is reproduceable it may be helpful to
me if you run jpilot -d to run in debug mode, reproduce the error and then
send me the log file from ~/.jpilot/jpilot.log

----------------------------------------------------------------------

These are some of the bugs that I know about:

*Priority High:

 - Palm databases aren't always detected as being changed and then aren't 
   brought into the desktop.
 - Sometimes you have to sync twice before the changes are synced into the 
   desktop.
 - Memory leaks when switching between apps.  I probably am not doing
   something right when destroying widgets.  I don't know what it is though.
 
*Priority Medium:

*Priority Low:
 - If a record is changed on the Palm and on the desktop, then the desktop 
   record will overwrite the one on the Palm.

*Priority Who Cares?:

*Quirks (not really bugs):

 - jpilot lets you enter in blank todo's, etc.  The palm pilot will not allow
   this.

 - The palm pilot will only let you make appointments on 5 minute intervals.
   jpilot will allow 1 minute intervals.

*Palm OS bugs that I have found while creating J-Pilot

 - If you try to sync with a pilotrate of 0, then the palm pilot with get a
   fatal exception and reboot.  This is a PalmOS bug.

 - The Palm pilot will let you sync (add) an appointment that repeats weekly,
   but doesn't repeat on any day.  It won't show up in the calendar, but if
   you search for it, it shows up.  When you click on it in find, Fatal
   Exception and Pilot reboots.  This is a PalmOS bug if you ask me.
