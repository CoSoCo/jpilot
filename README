J-Pilot is a palm pilot desktop for Linux/Unix written by:
Judd Montgomery, judd@engineer.com
It is very useable, but still has many planned updates to make it better.

If you like it feel to send me donations ;)
I collect coins from anywhere, anytime also.
At least send me an email and let me know you are using it.
I'd like to know how many people this is useful to.

SERIAL PORT SETUP:

When syncing, jpilot uses the port and speed settings out of the preferences
menu.  If the port is blank then jpilot will use the PILOTPORT environment
variables, as does pilot-link.  If these are blank then jpilot will default
to /dev/pilot.

It is recommended, but not neccessay to make a link from /dev/pilot to the
correct serial port.
So, if your cradle is on COM1, this is /dev/ttyS0 under Linux.  You could
execute the command "ln -s /dev/ttyS0 /dev/pilot".  COM2 is /dev/ttyS1, and
so on.

You must also give non-root users permisions to access the serial port.
The command to do this is (as root) "chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0" for the first
serial port, ttyS1, for the second, and so on.

COLORS:

Make install will copy a few default color files to /usr/local/share/jpilot/
(unless you told configure to use another prefix).
These will be selectable from the preferences menu.  Also jpilot will look
in $HOME/.jpilot/ for colors files.  They must start with "jpilotrc".
If you want to add new ones, or modify the current ones, just put the files
in one of these directories and they will show up in the preferences menu.

If you create your own cool jpilotrc files feel free to send them
back to me and if I like it, I'll include it in the release.

HOME:

jpilot uses the HOME environment variable to make it easy to allow multiple
pilots to be synced under the same unix user.  Just set HOME to the directory
you want jpilot to use.  For example, I have 2 palm pilots.  I can sync the
one I use all the time into /home/judd.  The other one I can sync into
/home/judd/palm2 by using this script:
#!/bin/bash
HOME=/home/judd/palm2
jpilot

This is also handy for syncing xcopilot into its own directory.
Normally, you can just leave HOME alone.

OOPS, REVERTING:

You can always make the databases revert back to the last time that the
pilot was synced.  All you have to do is "rm ~/.jpilot/*.pc".
Deleted records will come back, etc.  Nothing is permanent until the
sync/backup.  You can do this if you make a mistake, or just to play around 
with jpilot and then delete the changed records without syncing them.

Also, from the preferences menu, you can choose to show deleted records
and then click on the deleted record and use "Add" to get a copy of it back.

BACKUP and SYNC:

The Sync button will sync the 4 applications with the palm pilot.
The Backup button will backup every program and database from the palm pilot.

CLOCK UPDATE and flickers:

I don't know why, but the scrollbars flicker when the clock updates.  On some
systems it is bad, others not at all.  To get rid of this, just go into
preferences and choose a time without seconds.  Then the clock will only
update every minute.

USELESS STATISTIC:

I wrote about 600 lines of this code on my Palm Pilot using memo while I was
away from my computer.
I don't recomend this ;)
