It is very useable, but still has many planned updates to make it better.

If you like it feel to send me donations ;)
I collect coins from anywhere, anytime also.
email me and I'll send you my address.

If you use this program send me an email and let me know.  I'd like to know
how many people this is useful to.

You should copy the jpilotrc file to ~/.jpilot/ to get rid of the ugly grey
screens.  If you create your own cool jpilotrc files feel free to send them
back to me and if I like it, I'll include them in the release.  I'll
probably make a few selectable with a pull-down menu.
