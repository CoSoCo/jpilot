jpilot is a palm pilot desktop for Linux written by:

It is very useable, but still has many planned updates to make it better.

If you like it feel to send me donations ;)
I collect coins from anywhere, anytime also.
At least send me an email and let me know you are using it.  I'd like to know
how many people this is useful to.

jpilot reads the PILOTPORT environment variable to get the port to sync on.
If this is not set, then it defaults to /dev/pilot.  It also reads PILOTRATE
to get the serial port rate.

jpilot-syncd is a syncing daemon for jpilot.  It just sits and waits for the
Sync button to be pressed on the Palm pilot and then it syncs it.  This is
just an optional program.  It is not necessary.  I removed this in 0.92,
I'll probably put it back.

COLORS:

You should copy the jpilotrc file to ~/.jpilot/ to get rid of the ugly grey
screens.  If you create your own cool jpilotrc files feel free to send them
back to me and if I like it, I'll include it in the release.  I'll probably
make a few selectable with a pull-down menu.

HOME:

jpilot uses the HOME environment variable to make it easy to allow multiple
pilots to be synced under the same user.  Just set HOME to the directory
you want jpilot to use.

OOPS, REVERTING:

You can always make the databases revert back to the last time that the
pilot was synced.  All you have to do is "rm ~/.jpilot/*.pc".
Deleted records will come back, etc.  Nothing is permanent until the
sync/backup.  You can do this if you make a mistake, or just to play around 
with jpilot and then delete the changed records without syncing them.
