These are some of the things on my list todo, mostly, but not neccesarily
in this order:

* Remember the last user, so that different Palms can't accidentally be synced
* Printing
* Put up a graph showing the days schedual.
* Better daily schedual.
* Weekly schedual.
* Monthly schedual.
* Hide, or Show private records.
* Do a fast sync, user choice of fast, or slow.
* Add in file locking, right now if you run 2 jpilots as the same user
  then you may have DB file problems. (who cares?)
* Make a way to install files to the pilot.
* import/export files.
