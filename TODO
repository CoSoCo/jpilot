These are some of the things on my list todo, mostly, but not neccesarily
in this order:

* Printing
* Weekly schedule.
* Monthly schedule.
* Put up a graph showing the days schedule.
* Better daily schedule.
* Remember the last user, so that different Palms can't accidentally be synced
* Hide, or Show private records.
* Do a fast sync, user choice of fast, or slow.
* import/export files.
