These are some of the things on my list todo, not neccesarily in this order:


* fix category label in todo, adress, and memo apps
* fix return codes, they are a mess.
* Use autoconf to generate a configure script since they are so cool.
* Add in file locking, right now if you run 2 jpilots as the same user
  then you may have DB file problems. (who cares?)
* Put up a graph showing the days schedual.
* Make the datebook ask if an event is supposed to be in the 4th week,
  or if last week of the month.
* Hide, or Show private records.
* Let records be modified instead of just removed, or added.
* Do a fast sync, user choice of fast, or slow.
  (A slow sync allows another PC to do the archiving)
* Make the slow sync faster.
* Archive "to be archived" records?
* allow multiple pilots to sync in separate directories??
* Add in search functions
* Printing
* Make the output go into a window instead of stdout.
* Put in gtk hints.
* Put in a menubar if needed.
