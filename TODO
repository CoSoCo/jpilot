These are some of the things on my list todo, mostly, but not neccesarily
in this order:

* Add in search functions
* Printing
* Make preferences and rc files to remember settings.
* Use autoconf to generate a configure script since they are so cool.
* Put in a menubar if needed.
* Put up a graph showing the days schedual.
* Hide, or Show private records.
* Do a fast sync, user choice of fast, or slow.
  (A slow sync allows another PC to do the archiving)
* Add in file locking, right now if you run 2 jpilots as the same user
  then you may have DB file problems. (who cares?)
* fix return codes, and clean up the code, it is a little messy.
